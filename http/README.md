# Raspberry PI3/4 with I2T Sensors Stack  --  HTTP Protocol

The *Raspberry Pi* is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the *Raspberry Pi Foundation*. Early on, the Raspberry Pi project leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.

## Setting up your Raspberry with the I2T Sensors Stack

The following installation is done on **"Raspberry Pi OS"** (formerly Raspbian) and works for *Raspberry Pi 3* and *Raspberry Pi 4*.

This is the list of Sensors/Modules that you can connect and it will be recognized immediately.
- ***BME280*** (*Bosch*) - Temperature, Humidity and Pressure sensor. -> Connected by *I2C Bus* via: *GPIO2/SDA* and *GPIO3/SCL* --- Be careful with the supply of this sensor, the BM280 is powered with 3.3V, if your module does not have a voltage regulator (some modules do not have it) the sensor can be damaged if you supply 5V.
- ***MPU6050*** (*InvenSense-TDK*) - Acelerometer and Gyroscope 6-axis. -> Connected by *I2C Bus* via: *GPIO8/SDA* and *GPIO9/SCL*.
- ***BH1750*** (*ROHM*) - Ambient Light Sensor. -> Connected by *I2C Bus* via: *GPIO8/SDA* and *GPIO9/SCL*.
- ***Generic Adjustable Sound Sensor with digital output*** (like *KY038 Module*) - -> Digital Signal on *GPIO24*, +5V in *GPIO23* (to enable data collection).
- Also, you can connect a ***Green LED*** in *GPIO17* that blink when the data is sent to the Tangle, and a ***Red LED*** in *GPIO27* that will Blink in a certain way when it detects certain errors (totally optional)

### Connecting the sensors

The following diagram explains how each sensor of our stack must be connected to the Raspberry pins:

![I2T Sensors Stack on Raspberry](https://iot2tangle.io/assets/screenshots/Hardware_connections_Raspi-01.png)

**It is not necessary to have all the sensors listed here**, the code is able to detect which sensors were connected. In the case of not connecting any sensor, the only real data that will be displayed on the Tangle will be the Internal Temperature of *Raspberri Pi*.


## Setting up the Sensors Software

This software is written entirely in **C language**. External libraries are used, such as ***wiringpi*** (optimized library for Raspberry hardware handling), ***cURL*** (HTML Client library) and among others already integrated in *Raspberry Pi OS*.


### C Software Configuration:
In *Shell* of Raspberry Pi:

#### 1) Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install wiringpi libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
#### 2) Enable I2C in your Raspberry Pi if you never did. It is done only once:
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Use the down arrow to select 5: *'Interfacing Options'*, again use the arrow and select 5: *'I2C'*, then *Enable*.

#### 3) Copy the repository to the local file system of your Raspberry.
```
git clone https://github.com/iot2tangle/Raspberry.git
cd Raspberry/http
```
#### 4) Edit the file config.h

Edit the **config.h** file to define the values for your configuration: The *endpoint* and *port* that will have the *I2T Streams HTTP Gateway* running, the *Device Id*, and others configurations. The *Device Id* you define here must be between the devices you set in on the *Gateway configuration file*. 

Keep in mind that any changes on the config file will require to recompile the code.

```
const char* id_name = "Raspi-HTTP";

/* Endpoint Configuration */
const char* endpoint = "192.168.1.113/sensor_data";    /* Endpoint (HTTP), must NOT include 'http://xxx' or 'tcp://xxx' */
int port = 8080;

/* Enable Sensors */
bool isEnable_TemperatureIntern = true;
bool isEnable_TemperatureExtern = true;	   /* true: Enable  --  false: Disable */
bool isEnable_Humidity = true;
...

/* Interval of time */
long interval = 30;    /* Time in seconds between */
```

#### 5) Compile the code with:
```
make
```
#### 6) Run:
```
./Raspi-HTTP
```


If the *I2T Streams HTTP Gateway* is configured correctly (we will explain this next), ***you will be sending data to Tangle via Streams***. 

The following capture shows a *Raspberry Pi* with a *BME280* connected (note how the sensor is detected automatically):

Here we can see the result when all the sensors have been connected:

# Setting up the Streams HTTP Gateway

## Preparation

Install Rust if you don't have it already. More info about Rust here https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

Make sure you also have the build dependencies installed, if not run:  

`sudo apt install build-essential`  
`sudo apt install pkg-config`  
`sudo apt install libssl-dev`  
`sudo apt update`  

## Installing the Streams Gateway
Get the Streams Gateway repository
https://github.com/iot2tangle/Streams-http-gateway

`git clone https://github.com/iot2tangle/Streams-http-gateway`

Navigate to the root of **Streams-http-gateway** directory and edit the **config.json** file to define yours *device names*, *endpoint*, *port*, you can also change the IOTA Full Node used, among others.

## Start the Streams Server

### Sending messages to the Tangle

Run the Streams Gateway:  

`cargo run --release`  

This will compile and start the *Streams HTTP Gateway*. Note that the compilation process may take from 3 to 25 minutes (Pi3 took us around 15/25 mins, Pi4 8 mins and VPS or desktop machines will generally compile under the 5 mins) depending on the device you are using as host.
You will only go through the compilation process once and any restart done later will take a few seconds to have the Gateway working.

Once started, the ***Channel Id*** will be displayed, and the gateway will be open waiting for data to send to the Tangle.

*The Channel Id that will allow subscribers to access the channel data.*

### Reading messages from the Tangle

You can read the received messages directly from the "I2T Explorer": https://explorer.iot2tangle.io/ using the Channel Id printed by the Gateway in shell.
